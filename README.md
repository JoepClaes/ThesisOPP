# ThesisOPP
This repository contains the code for the plots in my master thesis about the Optimal Placement Problem

The titles of the files indicate their use and at the beginning of each file is a brief description of the analyses it can provide and the plots it can create. The letter "s" is used to indicate the static model and the letter "d" is used to indicate the dynamic model.
